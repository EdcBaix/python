    "Where objects are direct collections of data and methods that are performed on that data, <b> a Class is a blueprint for a collection of data.</b> When we write a Class, we are writing code that creates spaces and expectations for certain types of data as well as methods that can run on that data. It is essentially a pattern that allows us to write more performant code and lets us scale the complexity of our projects if we use them right. And thanks to Python, object and class creation are built in features of the language. This means that we can create several objects of that blueprint. Objects of classes are called <i>instances.</i>\n",

    "An instance of a class has access to all of the things that the declaration, the blueprint, defines for the class. With this we can actually separate the behavior of our code from the actual execution of it.\n",

    "This separation means that Classes have two parts to them, declaration and instantiation. Declaration is where we will make the blueprints and the details of the class. Instantiation will be creating objects of the Class. "
